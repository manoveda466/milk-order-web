# Image Assets - DEPRECATED

## ⚠️ This folder is no longer used for images in this Angular project.

Modern Angular uses the `public` folder for static assets.

## Correct Location for Images:
- **New Location**: `public/images/`
- **Current Image**: `public/images/milk.jpg` ✅ (already moved)

## For Future Images:
1. Place images in `public/images/` folder
2. Reference them in HTML as `src="images/filename.jpg"`
3. No need for `assets/` prefix

The milk.jpg image has been moved to the correct location and should now display properly!
